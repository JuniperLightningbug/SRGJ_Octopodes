  _title: 'Synthetic Aperture Radar: Ground Imaging'
  _content: By bouncing radio and microwaves waves off the surface of the planet,
    we can infer the structure of the ground, even through clouds! A Synthetic Aperture
    Radar (SAR) is an imaging radar that sends a pulse of signals to the ground,
    and then captures the returning signal. Since the SAR is orbiting, it will able
    to image the entirety of the planet over time and has the appearance of a extra
    bigger radar. Using different wavelengths and light polarity, we can image different
    types of structures, like land, vegetation, ice, and snow.
