  _title: 'UV Camera: Aurora'
  _content: When charged particles are accelerated down (precipitates) into a planet's
    atmosphere, it will collide with neutral particles and create light that we call
    the aurora. The aurora we see visibly on Earth is typically red, green, and purple,
    and we only see when the sky is dark. However, by looking at UV signatures we
    can see aurora generated by hydrogen (one of the most abundant element in the
    universe), and we can also see evidence of the aurora on the dayside. Looking
    for the aurora also lets us know the is enhanced solar activity has reached the
    planet and the radiation is particularly high.
