  title: Aurora
  description: Auroras display dynamic patterns of radiant light that appear as curtains,
    rays, spirals or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky. Auroras are the result
    of disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere caused by enhanced speeds of solar
    wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter
    the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles,
    mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere.
